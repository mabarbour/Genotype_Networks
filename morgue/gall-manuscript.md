# Introduction

## Outline

### Ecological networks - Interspecific but not Intraspecific

### Intraspecific works focus on 'species assemblages' or pairwise interactions or simple food chains

need to go beyond simple characterizations of food webs to examine their consequences...
### Research Questions/Hypotheses
(1) Does the probability of finding a particular gall species vary among willow genotypes? 

(2) Does the probability of finding a particular parasitoid species vary among willow genotypes? 

(3) Does the strength and direction of selection acting on particular gall species vary among willow genotypes?

(4) How does gall density and gall size interact to influence the probability of successful parasitoid attack?

(5) How do quantitative food web metrics vary among willow genotypes?

(6) How does network dissimilarity vary among willow genotypes?

(7) How does plant trait variation mediate dissimilarity in species interaction networks?

(8) Are species on correlated trajectories or do they diverge depending on willow genotype?



The evolution of herbivore resistance will be accelerated if the attack on susceptible genotypes is disproportionately greater than the attack on resistant genotypes; conversely, the rate of resistance evolution will be reduced by disproportionate attacks on resistant genotypes (Gould et al. 1991; Gould et al. 1994; Neuhauser et al. Ecology 2003)??? May simply be interested in whether there is density-dependent mortality or not.

Importance of intraspecific trait variation in shaping communities

The vast majority of community genetics research has focused on community composition [@Whitham2012a], thereby neglecting the more complex network of species interactions occuring between community members. Those studies that have moved beyond compositional descriptions and pairwise interactions have focused on simple food chains or aggregated species together at different trophic levels [@Stiling1996; @Bailey2006; @Fritz1995; @Mooney2008; @Abdala-Roberts2012]. However, research on ecological networks [@Ings2009] suggests that the architecture of species interactions within a food web may have profound consequences on food web dynamics [@Stouffer2011a; @Thebault2010]. My second chapter proposes to bridge research in community genetics and ecological networks to examine how genetic variation within a single host-plant species influences the structure of associated herbivore-parasitoid food webs.

## Background

Food webs represent a network of who eats whom in an ecological community. Typically, nodes within a food web network represent species, and links between nodes represent the presence/absence of a feeding interaction. One of the general properties of species-level food web networks is that they tend to be organized into compartments, or modules [@Krause2003; @Rezende2009; @Allesina2009; @Girvan2002]. These modules represents groups of species that interact with each other more frequently than would be expected by random chance [@Newman2006]. Recent work suggests that compartmentalization in food webs buffers the propogation of species extinctions throughout the network, thereby increasing the resilience of the food web to perturbations [@Stouffer2011a]. However, a persistent issue in food web research is the fact that species *per se* do not interact, but it is individuals within species that interact with each other [@Ings2009; @Gomez2012].  Since network structure has a fundamental influence on network dynamics [@Thebault2010; @Stouffer2011a; @Allesina2008], our understanding of food web dynamics may be hindered by not knowing the underlying structure of species-level networks.  

Aside from studying the consequences of network structure on dynamics, a lot of recent research has focused on examining the role of traits in establishing links within ecological networks. However, much of the work that has been done has focused on interspecific trait variation because network models have been interested in predicting species-level network structure [@Petchey2008a; @Eklof2013; @Rohr2010]. Consequently, we know little about how intraspecific trait variation structures interactions in more complex food webs. 

In this chapter, I examine whether host-parasitoid food webs exhibit a compartmentalized structure below the species level. In addition, I examine how intraspecific trait variation influences the structure of this interaction network. I propose to do this by examining the structure of willow genotype-gall-parasitoid networks in a common garden of 26 willow clones (described in Ch. 1).  This approach requires data on quantitative interaction strengths [@VanVeen2006]. Galling insects are ideal herbivores for studying quantitative food web structure, because they are often host to a diverse community of parasitoids [@Hawkins1988], as well as being relatively straightforward to collect, rear, and determine survival or identity of the attacking parasitoid. Willows provide an ideal study system because they host a diverse community of galling insects [@Nyman2007; @Gagne1989] and their is evidence that genetic variation within willows influences the organization of the galling insect community [@Fritz1988; @Hochwender2004] as well as parasitoid attack rates [@Fritz1995; @Fritz2003].  

## Hypotheses and Predictions

**Plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid species interaction networks tend to have a compartmentalized structure [@Cagnolo2011; @Lewinsohn2006]. A compartmented, or modular structure is a pattern in which groups of species interact with each other more so than would be expected by random chance. Ecological specialization appears to be the primary mechanism driving this biological pattern [@Lewinsohn2006]. This may explain why modular structures are common in host-parasite networks (e.g., plant-herbivore, herbivore-parasitoid), where both hosts and parasites have often evolved specific adapations for escaping/exploiting each other. However, expectations of how host-parasite interaction are structured may change if we look at interactions below the species level. For example, intraspecific trait variation is likely more continuous relative to interspecific variation. Consequently, we may expect the specificity of host-parasite interactions below the species level to exhibit more of a continuous gradient rather than discrete compartments. Therefore, I propose to examine the degree to which willow genotype-gall-parasitoid networks are structured from a continuous gradient to distinct compartments (Figure 3).**

In addition, I propose to examine the mechanisms by which plant genotype shapes gall-parasitoid interactions. Specifically, I hypothesize that plant genotype may shape the frequency of gall-parasitoid interactions in three fundamentally different ways: (1) variation in galling insect densities, (2) variation in gall size, or (3) variation in plant architecture.  I expect the first mechanism to act primarily on egg-parasitoids, because they attack before galls have begun to develop.  I predict the second mechanism to act primarily on late instar-parasitoids, which must oviposit through well-developed gall tissue.  For these two mechanisms, I predict that leaf phenolic chemistry and/or C:N content will be associated with these mechanisms.  This prediction stems from my observations that the abundance of the most common galling insect in the garden, *Iteomyia salicisverruca*, is positively correlated with leaf C:N.  In addition, leaf phenolic chemistry has been shown to be important for one of the gall-inducing sawfly species at the study site (*Pontania californica*, [@Roininen1999; @Nyman2000]). In regard to the third mechanism, I have two alternative predictions. First, galls may experience more frequent attack in plants with greater foliage density because these plants are associated with higher parasitoid densities (results Ch. 1; @Langellotto2004).  In contrast, more complex plant architecture may reduce parasitoid foraging efficiency [@Lawton1983] and consequently reduce parasitism rates on galling insects.

This paper examines how plant genetic variation influences herbivore-parasitoid interaction networks and how these networks shape selection pressures acting on herbivores.

**(1)** How does plant genotype influence gall-parasitoid interaction networks?

**(2)** How do different interaction networks influence the form of natural selection acting on herbivore traits?

*Possible (3)* How does the loss of plant genotypes influence gall-parasitoid interaction networks?


# Methods

To test these hypotheses, I took advantage of the same willow common garden described in Chapter 1 as well as the same plant trait measurements. 

### Gall Surveys and Sampling

In August and September of 2012, I collected all galls occurring on a haphazardly sampled basal branch for 5 replicates of each genotype. All galls were placed into 30 mL plastic transport tubes and maintained at room temperature.  After four months, I measured gall size, dissected them, and sorted insect larva and adults to morphospecies. To account for the number of shoots sampled for galls, I recorded the diameter of each sampled basal branch. I then recorded the number of shoots occuring on a measured basal branch of 26 different plants (one replicate of each genotype) and created an allometric equation to estimate the number of shoots sampled on each replicate plant.   

### Network Structure

To examine willow genotype-gall network structure, I propose to use two methods.  First, to examine whether there is more variation among than within genotypes in gall community composition, I will use 9,999 iterations of PERMANOVA on euclidean distances of my site-by-species matrix of gall densities, with genotype nested within gender.  Second, I will use the mean gall densities observed on each willow clone to build a quantitative bipartite network (Fig. 3a).  I will then use modularity analysis to examine whether certain plant genotypes and gall species formed distinct compartments or modules. Modularity analysis uses an algorithm to search for sets of nodes (e.g., species or individuals) in a network that interact with each other more frequently than would be expected by random chance [@Newman2006]. I plan to use the QuaBiMo algorithm developed by @Dormann2013, to evaluate the modularity, *Q*, of the network.  Since modularity relies upon an optimization routine, I will run 100 iterations and retain the highest value of modularity.  This value of modularity is dependent on the number of species in the network, the number of links between species, and the total number of observed interactions; therefore, I will use a null model to evaluate whether the network is more modular than I would expect by random chance.

To examine gall-parasitoid network structure, I propose to use three different approaches. First, I will build a quantitative bipartite network based on pooled observations of parasitoid rearings from each gall species. I will then use the same modularity analysis proposed above to examine whether gall and parasitoid networks form distinct modules at the species level (Fig. 3b).  Second, using the method described by @Poisot2012a, I will calculate the dissimilarity in quantitative gall-parasitoid networks among individual trees **(i.e. an individual by gall-parasitoid matrix)**. Each cell of the gall-parasitoid interaction matrix will correspond to the percentage of larva parasitized by a specific parasitoid species **on a particular host-plant individual**:
    
Interaction strength for each matrix cell = (count of parasitoid sp. *i*) / (count of parasitoid sp. *i* + count of other parasitoids attacking gall + count of surviving gall larva).   

I will then use PERMANOVA, to examine whether there is more variation among than within genotypes in gall-parasitoid network structure.  Finally, I will use mean frequencies of observed gall-parasitoid interactions on each willow clone to create a genotype-by-parasitism interaction matrix and use modularity analysis to examine whether certain genotypes are associated with certain gall-parasitoid interactions (Fig. 3c). 

### Intraspecific trait variation

To examine which plant traits influence galling insect densities **and gall sizes**, I will **use Redundancy Analysis (described in Ch. 1). Specifically, my multivariate response variables will include both galling insect densities and gall sizes observed on individual trees. My explanatory variables will include all leaf phenolic principal components, SLA, leaf water content, and leaf C:N.**conduct separate multiple linear regressions using all leaf phenolic principal components, SLA, leaf water content and leaf C:N as explanatory variables.  I will also conduct this same analysis to understand which plant traits influence gall sizes. 

I have *a priori* hypotheses about how the relative importance of gall density, gall size, and plant architecture in shaping gall-parasitoid interactions will likely depend on whether parasitoids attack eggs or late-instar larva. **To test these hypotheses, I will also use Redundancy Analysis, where the percentages of different gall-parasitoid interactions will be my multivariate response variables. As explanatory variables, I will include gall density, gall size, and plant architecture principal components.**; therefore, I will analyze each gall-parasitoid interaction with separate logistic regression models. For each regression, my response variable will be the frequency of a particular gall-parasitoid interaction on each willow clone, with the corresponding mean gall density, gall size, and plant architecture traits. 
 
###Allometry Data
Randomly selected 26 plants (one per genotype) to estimate the number of shoots sampled at a particular stem diameter. For each sampled branch, I counted the total number of shoots eminating from the the branch. I then used linear regression to come up with an equation to estimate the total number of shoots sampled at a particular stem diameter.

#### Q1
Build a meta-web of herbivore-parasitoid interactions by pooling across all genotypes (try a both qualitative and quantitative version, hopefully both will yield the same results)

Run an appropriate modularity algorithm to identify modules on the meta-web.

***Figure out how to quantify the frequency of representation of the different modules.***

Run a chi-square test based on the frequencies of each module occurring on each genotype to see whether there is an association.

### Q2
Build a meta-web of herbivore-parasitoid interactions by pooling across all genotypes (try both qualitative and quantitative version, hopefully both will yield the same results)

Evaluate the structure of the meta-web (nested or modular or both).

Compute the appropriate network measure for each replicate of each genotype and see whether I can detect any correlations between network structure and genetic distance or traits.

Could also use the method proposed in Poisot 2012 (Dissimilarity of Interaction Networks), but it doesn't examine how network structure changes (this may or may not be important, depending on whether I see any noticeable changes in my graphs of the different networks)

Could also see how the functional role of species (Guimera and Amaral Functional Cartography paper in Nature) change across genotypes.  Test this using a chi-square analysis based on genotypes and the seven different functional roles (I'm thinking now I won't see a big difference...)

***What I think may be a promising method***: Look for dissimilarity in module participation, by creating a matrix of all possible interactions (e.g H1,P1 H1,P2 H2,P1 etc.) for a particular module on a tree (or genotype), then calculate a bray-curtis dissimilarity within modules across the trees/genotypes.  Then see if this is associated with any particular gall and/or plant traits.**this is a more likely area where we will see gall trait variation influencing the network**

***Conversation with Rudolf***: Look for mantel correlation between dissimilarity in herbivore traits (e.g. gall size, multilocularity, etc.) and dissimilarity in network topology (e.g. see Bersier et al. 2002, for quantitative versions of network measures).  And see whether this correlation varies across genotypes.  Or simply look to see whether the quantitative versions of these network metrics vary across genotypes (similar to Tylianakis et al. 2007, but with different genotypes instead of habitats)

### Q3
Option 1: Use partial mantel tests and path analysis to see how genetic distance and trait dissimilarity influence dissimilarity in module frequency (either all modules combined, or modules individually).  Consider at first using all plant traits and then looking at individual traits.

Also, look for patterns between genotypes and herbivore traits, as well as herbivore traits and network topology.  Could use a mantel test for genetic distance and herbivore trait dissimilarity and measures of network topology.
