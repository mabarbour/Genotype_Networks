When genes from a species get phased out, the entire ecosystem can be affected.

3 key points:
(method)- We planted a huge field of willow trees, where each tree had a unique combination of genes. (mention clones here?)
(result)- We found that trees with different genes supported different food chains.

We found that the genes of the tree affected which flies fed on the trees, which in turn, affected which wasps attacked the flies. 


We found that trees with different genes affected how each insect gets food, and how nutrients and energy are passed from insect to insect. (go on internet and think about the best way to describe the plant insect food web and food chain).

(implication)- When genes from a tree species get phased out, all of the species that depend on the tree can be affected. 

Food chains show how each living thing gets food, and how nutrients and energy are passed from creature to creature.

In this study, we planted a huge field of willow trees. Although all of these trees were the same species, they differed in the sets of genes. 

25 clones

We found that insects prefer to feed on plants with certain genes. But these gene effects don?t stop with the bugs, they affect the entire food chain because they also affect which predators eat the insects. 

We then ran a computer simulation to see how losing genes from a tree species affect the other species that depend on the tree.
