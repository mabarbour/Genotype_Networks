# Project Summary (in plain language)
**What we did**: We planted a huge field with 25 different clones of Coastal willow (*Salix hookeriana*). 

**What we found**: We found that the genes of the willow tree affected which flies fed on the tree, which in turn affected which tiny wasps (parasitoids) attacked the flies.

**Why this matters**: When genes from a tree get phased out, all of the species that depend on that tree can be affected. 

These findings are in press at *PNAS* in a paper entitled, "Genetic specificity of a plant-insect food web: implications for linking genetic variation to network complexity".
